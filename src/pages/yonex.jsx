                  Yonex produces equipment and apparel for tennis, badminton,
                  golf, and running. The company was founded in 1946 by Minoru
                  Yoneyama as a producer of wooden floats for fishing nets.

                  <p>
                    The company was later forced out of this market because of
                    the invention of plastic floats. This led to a commitment by
                    Yoneyama to never again be left behind by technological
                    advancements.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In 1957, Yoneyama began to make badminton racquets for other
                    brands. By 1961, the first Yoneyama-branded racquet was
                    introduced, and within another two years an export company
                    was created for the worldwide distribution. After the
                    company began to make aluminium badminton racquets in 1969,
                    it found that the same technology could be applied to the
                    tennis racket which the company introduced in 1971. The
                    company began to experiment with graphite shafts for both
                    types of rackets and found that these would also be useful
                    for golf clubs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In 1982 Yonex came out with the new oversized tennis racquet
                    in the REX-series with the R-7 and R-10 rackets. At that
                    time Martina Navratilova played with the R-7 and was very
                    successful. One year later, the new series Rexking was
                    developed with the R-22. Navratilova subsequently used the
                    white RQ 180 widebody frame until the early 1990s.

                    Finding a growing market, the Yonex Corporation (a wholly
                    owned subsidiary) was established in Torrance, California,
                    US in July 1983. In 1992 Yonex introduced the widebody
                    badminton racket, the &quot;Isometric 500&quot;, a racket
                    that was much less &quot;tear drop&quot;-shaped than
                    previous ones. The more &quot;square&quot; head gave it a
                    much larger striking surface, which provides a larger
                    &quot;sweet &quot;spot&quot; to hit the shuttle. It led
                    other manufacturers to follow suit in
                    &quot;square-head&quot; or isometric designs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The parent company was listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in
                    1994. Yonex describes itself as the world leader in golf,
                    tennis and badminton equipment. Yonex provides clothing for
                    national badminton associations around the world, such as
                    the Malaysian Badminton Association, Badminton Scotland,
                    Badminton England, Badminton Ireland, and Badminton Wales.
                    Yonex has also been teaming up with OCBC (Orange County
                    Badminton Club) since 2007 to host the annual U.S. Open
                    Grand Prix Badminton Championships.

                    Yonex has become the dominant corporate player in badminton.
                    Yonex sponsors the All England Open Badminton Championships
                    and is a partner of the Badminton World Federation which
                    organizes the World Championships. Upwards of 80% of
                    competitive players use their racquets, as it is the
                    preferred choice amongst professionals. Yonex is significant
                    in the tennis and golf industries as well and is a major
                    sponsor of professional athletes in all three sports.
